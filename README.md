# Tweet-counter

## Description
An iOS application implemented using swift language, to count tweet characters just like [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com)!
Firstly, we have to know that [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) has a special mechanism in counting characters and it's explained [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/counting-characters) in details.

Implementation of this app is focused on following this mechanism as far as possible.
