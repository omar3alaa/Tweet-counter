# Tweet-counter

## Description
An iOS application implemented using swift language, to count tweet characters just like [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com)!
Firstly, we have to know that [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) has a special mechanism in counting characters and it's explained [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/counting-characters) in details.

Implementation of this app is focused on following the previously mentioned mechanism as far as possible.

## Project's structure

### 1. `Tweet-Counter` target:
The main project and made here as an example of how to use `Tweet counter`, It's architected with `VIPER` as it has reusable components that could be used in other modules, those reusable components such as `AuthorizeTwitterInteractor` & `PostTweetInteractor`.

### 2. `TweetCounterUIComponents` SPM:
A SPM used to encapsulate all UI components inside one package to be used by many internal projects, it now holds only the custom view `TweetCounter` with its relative files.
 * `TweetCounter` module here is architected with `MVVM with RxSwift` because it's somehow needs to be a reactive component as it's used to calculate length of user's input text while typing it.

### 3. `TweetCounterUtilities` SPM:
A SPM used to encapsulate all helpers, extensions, and any shared logic that could be used in multiple projects.
